# austin-animal-center

🐱🐶 **Project Goals:**

- Have animal intakes at the Austin Animal Center increased or decreased each year since 2016? Plot a column chart of intakes by year.
- Are there seasonal monthly trends in overall animal intakes? Plot intakes by year/month from 2016 to current, including 2021. (One long line or column chart)
- Plot that same monthly trend, except with month as the x-axis, with a new line for each year.
- Do certain types of animals drive seasonal trends? Use five full years of data (not 2021) to summarize intakes by animal type and month. Plot with month on the x-axis with a line for each animal type.
